	<h4>In many ways, hostel life defines the life of a student in campus and the experience helps them learn a lot about life and socializing. Life at ACSCE hostels comes with its own traditions, some of them quite unique. Hostel is guaranteed for needy students, and approximately 300 people live in this large campus- a perfect blend of academic and residential life. The hostel wings are the hubs of activity. One of the first things a fresher (what a sophomore is called here) needs to learn is the administrative body of the hostels, which include the warden, the assistant warden, the hall manager and the mess manager. Most day-to-day hostel matters are managed by the students, who are often given a free hand. We use to conduct many orientation programs.</h4>

	<h4>Many orientation programs are held for all fresh entrants to bring them up-to-date with life within the hostel as well as on the campus. Attending the orientations is important, because it is these sessions that help successive generations of students discover. These sessions also help them to gradually get absorbed into the rich and diverse culture of extra-curricular activities on campus.</h4>
